# Queens Bot
A novelty to beat all your connections at the game of queens. In order to get it to work you need to create a file called
.env containing the following.

`
PATH_TO_GECKODRIVER=your\path\to\geckodriver.exe
`

or change the main file directly

Then just launch main and ^C to stop it
+ did not find how to get queens w/o preplaced queens directly so maybe I'll add that later
